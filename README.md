40kW, 600V, 3 phase inverter with FOC 

This is my Electronics Engineering final project, an open source, 40kW, 600V, 3 phase inverter. The goal is to design and implement a bidirectional power inverter that is fault-tolerant. The inverter will use Field-Oriented Control, and will be capable of operating in both sensored and sensorless modes, as well as having autotuning and testing features. The target power densities for the inverter are 50 kW/liter and 30 kW/kg, and it will be designed with a variety of control and power requirements in mind. A desktop application will be developed and will enable live plots, serial communication, and data logging for monitoring the inverter states.

## 📁 Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files and directories:

* [🕹️ Control/](https://github.com/dweggg/Inverter/blob/main/Control/): This directory contains the MATLAB & Simulink files used to undestand and develop the FOC.
* [🛠️ HW/](https://github.com/dweggg/Inverter/blob/main/HW/): This directory contains all the design documents, such as schematics, PCB layouts, and BOM.
* [💾 SW/](https://github.com/dweggg/Inverter/blob/main/SW/): This directory contains the firmware code for the inverter, which is written in C and uses a PIC32MK microcontroller.
* [💻 app/](https://github.com/dweggg/Inverter/blob/main/app/): This directory will contain the desktop app for tuning and testing the inverter.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- 📥 Get the hardware: Use the existing Gerber files and BOM data to order PCB/PCBA or develop your own hardware based off the existing KiCad project.
- 💿Install the firmware: Download MPLAB X IPE for deployment of the .hex file or use MPLAB X IDE to develop more code. Use a PICKit3 to program the MCU.
